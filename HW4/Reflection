Working in Bitsy forced me to confront how much meaning can be produced by constraint. The engine is intentionally small: rooms are discrete, interactions are sparse, and nothing happens unless the system explicitly allows it. This made every design decision feel less like traditional storytelling and more like negotiating with an interface. I wasn’t asking what story I wanted to tell so much as what actions the system would recognize as legitimate. Reading Alexander Galloway alongside this process clarified that what I was really designing was not a narrative, but a protocol—rules that determine what inputs count and which are ignored.

My game leans into this logic by foregrounding moments where the player expects progress but receives none. Text like “Depth increasing” or “You descend anyway” acknowledges player intent without rewarding it. This design choice mirrors Iron Lung, where movement and observation are mediated entirely through instruments that offer delayed, incomplete, or unsettling feedback. In both cases, the player’s agency is real but tightly constrained; you can act, but you cannot meaningfully change the system you are trapped inside.

Bitsy’s room structure made this especially clear. Rooms do not connect unless explicitly authorized, and endings completely freeze the game world. At several points, I assumed the game was broken when it was actually functioning exactly as designed. Rather than correcting this confusion, I chose to preserve it. This reflects Galloway’s claim that control in games operates at the level of systems rather than narrative illusion. The rules persist regardless of the player’s expectations.

Ultimately, Bitsy’s pixelated minimalism and Iron Lung’s oppressive interface reveal the same uncomfortable truth: interaction does not guarantee influence. Sometimes the only thing the player can do is continue pressing forward, even when nothing visibly changes.
